= Bugs

* Does not build on OS X
* Ctrl+C breaks things
* Some keys are interpreted as Ctrl+something combination (e.g. Tab - ^I, Return - ^J)
* Multi-key commands are not recognized as such (e.g. 'dd' will be treated as two separate actions). This one requires lot of work.

= Features TODO

* More sophisticated pattern recognition:
** Make use of timestamps
** Don't distinguish between some keys (e.g. j, h, k and l)
** Come up with some more ideas
* Several instances running simultaneously.
* Handle nicely control sequences
* Config parsing: error handling and cleanup

= Code maintenance

* Uniform error handling
* Document code
* Clean up and split up analyze.c
