# Installation

1. Run `make` to build the wrapper tool.
2. Add the `bin/` subdir to your `PATH` environment variable
   or create a symlink to the `bin/hvim` file and put it
   somewhere in your `PATH`.

# Usage

Simply use the `hvim` command just as you would use `vim`.

# Configuration

Edit the `bin/hvim` file. It's pretty straightforward.
